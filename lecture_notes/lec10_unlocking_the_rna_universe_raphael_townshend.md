Abstract:
In this talk we will discuss how Atomic AI is developing foundation models integrated in a virtuous cycle with purpose-designed, in-house wet-lab assays, to discover and design RNA drugs. By tightly coupling both algorithmic development and large-scale data generation, we will explore how we can build on AI-augmented structural biology tools such as AlphaFold to transform the design of RNA-targeted and RNA-based medicines.  Such applications reveal the ability of large language models to unlock novel therapeutics to treat undruggable diseases in cancer, neurodegeneration, infectious disease, and other areas.

## Notes

- misc info:
  - shape determines structure e.g. I really like the bike shape analogy, tbh it wasn't obvious at all to me.
  - it (dna?) becomes 80% rna more than protein
  - targeting proteing is not enough, we'd like to go after rna
  - cure diseases by targeting rna
  - rna is less known than protein
  - AI helps to guide experiments and experiments help to refine AI

# Question

Hi Raphael,

First thanks for coming back to Stanford to cs 324 to share your knowledge! It's really appreciated. Seems like
some of my questions were skipped and I was very curious. I couldn't find your stanford email so I am contacting you
here. Hope it's ok. Numbering to help you with the response:

Q1: Are GNNs useful for solving biological problem given the current Foundation Model (FM) novel data emergence paradigm? 
Is perhaps large high quality data with large models all we need?

Q2: self attention scales quadratically with sequence length, how do you deal with that with long sequences in bio/protein/rna sequences?

Q3: I don't know enough about biology so this might be a dumb question. 
But what are the real new "uncurable diseases we have cured with the given 'breakthroughs in ML for BIO'? bio question, why is rna more important than proteins?

Q4: can you put equivariance induction biases into LLMs? or is only data augmentation the best way to do it?

Q5: how do we know we are limiting the ML models by putting these equivariance induction biases into them? e.g. perhaps
the reason handcrafting has not worked is the following: these things are very complicated. So we try to put an 
inductive bias into the model but that has a very unexpected cascade of effects that leads to a large limitation in
the models ability to learn. But if it would have learned it on it's own it would have lead to a similar inductive bias
without any of those negative unexpected limitations. Similar to the "butterfly effect" in physics. So perhaps we should
let the data speak for itself?


Thank you for your time! I really appreciate it! If your ever at Stanford would love to say hi in person!

Sincerely, Brando Miranda

Summary:
Raphael Townshend is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer at Atomic AI, a biotechnology company using artificial intelligence to enable the next generation of RNA drug discovery. Prior to founding Atomic AI, Raphael studied his PhD at Stanford University, where he wrote his thesis on Geometric Learning of Biomolecular Structure and taught in Stanfordâ€™s machine learning and computational biology programs. He has been recognized in Forbes 30 Under 30, and his work has been featured on the cover of Science, recognized by a Best Paper award at NeurIPS, and published in other top venues such as Nature, Cell, and ICLR. During his PhD program, Raphael also held positions at DeepMind and Google on their artificial intelligence and software engineering teams, and founded the inaugural workshop on machine learning and structural biology.

## Feedback for staff

- Scribes:
  - I think we should have scribes that jot down the questions from discord and then answer them based on the discussion
  section. Add that to 5% attendance 5% scribe of discussion questions, ppl only need to scribe once and groups of 
  2-3 should be very doable.
